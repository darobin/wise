      <p>
        Browsers, and the browser engines that power them, provide critical public infrastructure to over five
        billion people. To cover the high cost of maintaining such complex feats of engineering, browser 
        vendors and search engine providers have improvised a system in which money is levied from search 
        revenue and distributed to browsers. Over the years, this ad hoc system has succeeded in providing some
        funding to browsers but it suffers from a muddled lack of transparency and has known detrimental effects
        on funding attribution, concentration, search quality, privacy, misinformation, publisher revenue, and 
        opinion pluralism. This specification captures the web community's experience with the current system so 
        as to refine requirements and formalizes a browser/search levy that improves on the current one and 
        addresses its shortcomings.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As of 2022, 63% of the world population, or roughly 5 billion people, used the Internet ([[?Internet-Users]]).
        While some of these may not use a <dfn data-lt="browser">browser</dfn> (the application used to navigate the 
        web) regularly, all use a <dfn>browser engine</dfn> (the software component that both browsers and other apps
        use to render web content) regularly as those are widely used in applications in addition to forming the 
        core of [=browsers=].
      </p>
      <p>
        [=Browsers=] and [=browser engines=] are provided to people free of charge, as public goods. Their continued
        provision is critical since without them the web collapses. They are also complex: for instance, in 2022
        Chromium (the [=browser engine=] powering Google Chrome and other [=browsers=]) ran to about 35 million lines
        of code. The total annual cost of maintaining the three primary browser engines is estimated to be around
        $2 billion USD ([[?Where-Browsers]]). While this cost is significant, it is only a small fraction of the
        direct value (monetary or otherwise) produced by the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to assemble the funds required to operate, almost all browser vendors rely on variations on the 
        same strategy: they exercise an ad hoc levy on search engine revenue. Variations on this levy include
        selling the search engine [=default=] (the initial and typical approach), [=royalties=] on search volume,
        or [=intra-company transfers=] (when the search engine and browser belong to the same company). Taken
        together, these strategies form the [=AHLD=] system, which is described further in the next section.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite its critical importance to web infrastructure, the [=AHLD=] system is opaque and poorly documented,
        and suffers from a number of undesirable shortcomings that have large-scale detrimental effects on the web.
        By formalizing this levy and deliberately architecting it to produce improved results, we can
        simultaneously put the funding of critical public digital infrastructure on much surer footing and address 
        the [=AHLD=] system's issues.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>The <em>Ad Hoc Levy on Defaults (AHLD)</em> System</h2>
      <p>
        The <dfn data-lt="AHLD">Ad Hoc Levy on Defaults</dfn> (AHLD) is a system in which a portion of search engine
        revenue is levied and used to pay browsers. (It is also used for operating systems and other agents, but our
        focus in this document is browsers.) The levy ensures that browsers, which constitute criticial infrastructure
        for the web, are provided free of charge to people. It can take multiple typical forms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <dfn data-lt="default">Default placement</dfn>: the browser vendor sells its default search function to a 
          search engine. Defaults have an outsized impact on search volume as few users change them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn>Royalties</dfn>: the browser vendor gets a share of the revenue when directing traffic to a given search 
          engine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <dfn>Intra-company transfers</dfn>: the browser vendor and search engine vendor are the same company, and
          revenue from the latter contributes to paying for the former. In effect, this is a horizontally
          integrated variant of [=default placements=] that is cheaper and of greater strategic value. (For smaller
          search engines, it may also be the only deal they can make.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These deals are negotiated bilaterally, and in practice an [=AHLD=] agreement between a browser vendor and 
        a search engine vendor can marry aspects from several of these forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        [=AHLD=] levies are economically significant and constitute one of the larger commercial exchanges on the 
        web. For instance, in the year 2021 Google Search spent over $26 billion USD on [=default placement=] deals 
        ([[?26-Billion-Default]]) â€” which does not include its [=intra-company transfer=] costs â€” and paid 36% of 
        its search advertising revenue made in Safari to Apple ([[?Apple-36]]). In 2020, Mozilla made 86% of its 
        revenue from the Google Search levy ([[?Mozilla-Revenue]]). <span class="note">Note: We have to use relatively 
        old numbers due to the unfortunate lack of transparency that the [=AHLD=] system suffers from. To the best
        of our knowledge, the situation has not significantly evolved since.</span>

        <h2>Known Issues</h2>
        <p>
          this levy is good but it has issues
          one concern is that, if we don't address the issues, we will lose the levy and that will make it very hard to pay for browsers
          we need to act
          unfortunately limited transparency, despite being the beating heart of web infrastructure -> issues
