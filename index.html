        Browsers, and the browser engines that power them, provide critical public infrastructure to over five
        billion people. To cover the high cost of maintaining such complex feats of engineering, browser 
        vendors and search engine providers have improvised a system in which money is levied from search 
        revenue and distributed to browsers. Over the years, this ad hoc system has succeeded in providing some
        funding to browsers but it suffers from a muddled lack of transparency and has known detrimental effects
        on funding attribution, concentration, search quality, privacy, misinformation, publisher revenue, and 
        opinion pluralism. This specification captures the web community's experience with the current system so 
        as to refine requirements and formalizes a browser/search levy that improves on the current one and 
        addresses its shortcomings.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        As of 2022, 63% of the world population, or roughly 5 billion people, used the Internet ([[?Internet-Users]]).
        While some of these may not use a <dfn data-lt="browser">browser</dfn> (the application used to navigate the 
        web) regularly, all use a <dfn>browser engine</dfn> (the software component that both browsers and other apps
        use to render web content) regularly as those are widely used in applications in addition to forming the 
        core of [=browsers=].
      </p>
      <p>
        [=Browsers=] and [=browser engines=] are provided to people free of charge, as public goods. Their continued
        provision is critical since without them the web collapses. They are also complex: for instance, in 2022
        Chromium (the [=browser engine=] powering Google Chrome and other [=browsers=]) ran to about 35 million lines
        of code. The total annual cost of maintaining the three primary browser engines is estimated to be around
        $2 billion USD ([[?Where-Browsers]]). While this cost is significant, it is only a small fraction of the
        direct value (monetary or otherwise) produced by the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to assemble the funds required to operate, almost all browser vendors rely on variations on the 
        same strategy: they exercise an ad hoc levy on search engine revenue. Variations on this levy include
        selling the search engine default (the initial and typical approach), royalties on search volume,
        or intra-company transfers (when the search engine and browser belong to the same company). Taken
        together, these strategies form the [=AHLD=] system, which is described further in the next section.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite its critical importance to web infrastructure, the [=AHLD=] system is opaque and poorly documented,
        and suffers from a number of undesirable shortcomings that have large-scale detrimental effects on the web.
        By formalizing this levy and deliberately architecting it to produce improved results, we can
        simultaneously put the funding of critical public digital infrastructure on much surer footing and address 
        the [=AHLD=] system's issues.
