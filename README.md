# Web Infrastructure Search Endowment (WISE)

Browsers, and the browser engines that power them, provide critical public infrastructure to over five
billion people. To cover the high cost of maintaining such complex feats of engineering, browser 
vendors and search engine providers have improvised a system in which money is levied from search 
revenue and distributed to browsers. Over the years, this ad hoc system has succeeded in providing some
funding to browsers but it suffers from a muddled lack of transparency and has known detrimental effects
on funding attribution, concentration, search quality, privacy, misinformation, publisher revenue, and 
opinion pluralism. This specification captures the web community's experience with the current system so 
as to refine requirements and formalizes a browser/search levy that improves on the current one and 
addresses its shortcomings.
